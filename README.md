This challenge is supposed to store the data written in the text box and save it into localStorage to be used for next time website is opened.
You can save and unsave the user input by clicking the botton on the final column of each row.
The textboxes are also supposed to turn green, red, or grey depending on the current real time.

I will keep working on this homework.
